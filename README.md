## The Vision

Every day, millions of people struggle to use technology that wasn’t designed for their eyes. From elderly parents squinting at tiny fonts to young professionals battling eye strain, digital life is becoming harder - not easier.

**Netra changes that.**

We are building the first **personalized vision wellness app** that doesn’t just *adjust settings* - it *adapts the entire digital experience* to the way **you** see the world. Netra calibrates your device to your unique eyesight, creating effortless readability, reducing strain, and helping people live more comfortably in our screen-first world.

Imagine a phone that understands your vision:

* Fonts that resize *just right* for your eyes.
* Contrast that adapts to the sunlight outside.
* Gentle reminders to blink, stretch, and rest before strain sets in.
* A digital environment where accessibility isn’t an afterthought, but the **default.**

Our mission is simple yet powerful:
👉 To **give clarity back to the digital generation** - so that whether you’re 18 or 80, technology empowers you instead of exhausting you.

With **AI-driven personalization, accessibility-first design, and wellness insights**, Netra is reimagining how we interact with screens. Because vision is more than seeing - it’s living fully.
